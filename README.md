# R Package **bpplot**

A small R package with a single user function, `bpplot()`, which creates daily blood-pressure graphs. For a more generally capable blood-pressure package, see the **bp** package on CRAN (<https://github.com/johnschwenck/bp> and <https://cran.r-project.org/package=bp>).

To install from GitHub:

```         
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")

```
